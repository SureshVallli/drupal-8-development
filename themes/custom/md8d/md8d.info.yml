#** We are choosing the machine names for our regions based on what          **
#** classy/templates/layout/page.html.twig recognizes because this is what   **
#** we are inheriting. However, you should pay attention to where that       **
#** template places each region. We'd prefer the secondary region to appear  **
#** above the header region. That's not what classy's template does, though. **
#** We can copy that template into our theme and modify it to our liking,    **
#** if we choose.                                                            **
